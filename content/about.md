And I am a tech enthusiast, creator, and amateur blogger who loves everything geeky. From anime to videogames, I'm
always up for trying out the latest gadgets and software. Whenever I'm not tinkering with my computers or playing video
games, you can find me sipping a cup of coffee (or two, maybe three). If you happen to love geeky stuff, coffee, and
laughter then you just might be in the right place! Stick around theres plenty of shenanigans to come.
